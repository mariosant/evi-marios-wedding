Evi & Mario's Wedding site
==========================

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/qboss/evi-marios-wedding.png?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/qboss/evi-marios-wedding)

Me and Evi are getting married, so, I built a small website that contains the needed information for our guests!
This website is built using Middleman and a heavily modified template I bought from Themeforest.

You can check the website at http://www.evi-marios-wedding.info.
